				<p>Self-isolation is when you do not leave your home because you have or might have coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>		
				<p>This helps stop the virus spreading to other people.</p>
				<p>Self-isolation is different to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="">social distancing</a> - general advice for everyone to avoid close contact with other people</li>
					<li><a href="">shielding</a> - advice for people at high risk from coronavirus.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="nhsuk-inset-text nhsuk-u-margin-top-10">
					<p>It's a legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive or are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. You could be fined if you do not self-isolate.</p>

					<li>you've tested positive for coronavirus - this means you have coronavirus</li>
