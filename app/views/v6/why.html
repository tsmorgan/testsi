			<h1>Why it’s important to self-isolate </h1>
			<p>Self-isolating when you have coronavirus (COVID-19) or have been in close contact with someone who has the virus can stop it spreading to other people.</p>
      <p>Coronavirus can spread though:</p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>coughs and sneezes</li>
        <li>tiny droplets when you breathe or speak</li>
        <li>touching objects and surfaces with the virus on them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>People who have coronavirus can infect others from around 2 days before their symptoms start, and for up to 10 days after. Self-isolating for 10 full days can help stop the spread.</p>

      <h2>Why you still need to self-isolate if you do not have symptoms</h2>
      <p>It’s important to self-isolate even if you feel well.</p>
      <p>It can take several days for symptoms of coronavirus to appear. You could have the virus but not know it yet.</p>
      <p>About 1 in 3 people with the virus do not get symptoms, but can still spread it to other people.</p>

      <h2>Why the people you live with are asked to self-isolate</h2>
			<p>Coronavirus spreads more easily when people are close to each other, especially when they’re inside without regular fresh air.</p>
      <p>If you have coronavirus, any people you live with are at high risk of getting it too. </p>
      <p>They could spread it to others even if they feel well, which is why they may also be asked to self-isolate.</p>

      <h2>Self-isolation is a legal requirement</h2>
			<p>As self-isolation is so important, it's a legal requirement to do it if you test positive or are told to by NHS Test and Trace. You could be fined if you do not self-isolate.</p>
