			<p>It's crucial we all play our part in defeating the coronavirus (COVID-19 ). By effectively self-isolating when we should, we protect ourselves, our families, friends and local communities and break the chains of transmission.</p>  
			<p>Self-isolation is about protecting others and slowing down the spread of coronavirus. It's very important that anyone who has the virus, or might have been exposed to it, limits the number of people they come into contact with for 10 days. This is the most effective way of preventing coronavirus from spreading.</p>
			<p>Around 1 in 3 people that have COVID-19 are asymptomatic, this means they don't have coronavirus symptoms and feel healthy. If you're asked to self-isolate, follow the advice even if you feel well. This helps keep you, your loved ones, and your community safe.</p>
			<h2>How COVID-19 is spread</h2>
			<p>COVID-19 spreads from person to person through small droplets, aerosols and through direct contact. Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated with COVID-19 when people with the infection cough or sneeze or touch them. The risk of spread is greatest when people are close to each other, especially in poorly ventilated indoor spaces and when people spend a lot of time together in the same room.</p>
			<p>People who have COVID-19 can infect others from around 2 days before symptoms start, and for up to 10 days after. They can pass the infection to others, even if they have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which is why they must stay at home.</p>
			<p>People who live in the same household as someone with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing COVID-19. They could spread the disease to others even when feeling well, which is why they too must stay at home.</p>
			<h2>Law and penalties about self-isolation</h2>
			<p>It's a legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive or are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. You could be fined if you do not self-isolate.</p> 
			<h2>Benefits of self-isolation</h2>
			<p>Self-isolating will reduce the spread of coronavirus and help prevent family, friends and the community from contracting coronavirus, as well as helping to protect the NHS.</p>
