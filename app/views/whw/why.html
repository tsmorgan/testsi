			<h1>Why self-isolate</h1>
			<p>Self-isolation is about protecting others and slowing down the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). It's very important that anyone who has the virus, or might have been exposed to it, limits the number of people they come into contact with for 10 days. This is the most effective way of preventing coronavirus from spreading. If you're asked to self-isolate, follow the advice to help keep you, your loved ones, and your community safe.</p>
			<h2>How COVID-19 is spread</h2>
			<p>People who have COVID-19 can infect others from around 2 days before symptoms start, and for up to 10 days after. They can pass the infection to others, even if they have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which is why they must stay at home.</p>
			<p>People who live in the same household as someone with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing COVID-19. They could spread the disease to others even when feeling well, which is why they must stay at home.</p>
			<p>COVID-19 spreads from person to person through small droplets, aerosols and through direct contact. Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated with COVID-19 when people with the infection cough or sneeze or touch them. The risk of spread is greatest when people are close to each other, especially in poorly ventilated indoor spaces and when people spend a lot of time together in the same room.</p>
