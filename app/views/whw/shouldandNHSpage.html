	<p>If you've tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) or have symptoms, however mild, you should self-isolate immediately and for the next full 10 days. Everyone you live with should also self-isolate immediately.</p>
	<h2>Self-isolate immediately if:</h2>
	<ul>

		<li>someone you live with has symptoms or tested positive.</li>
		<li>someone in your <a href="">support bubble</a> has symptoms and you've been in close contact with them since their symptoms started or during the 48 hours before they started</li>

		<li>you've been told you've been in contact with someone who tested positive - <a href="">find out what to do if you're told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS COVID-19 app</a></li>
		<li>you arrive in the UK from a country with a high coronavirus risk - see <a href="">GOV.UK: how to self-isolate when you travel to the UK</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the NHS COVID-19 app detects you've been at a venue with someone who has coronavirus, please self-isolate when you receive the message alert.</p>
	<p>If you are under 18 years old, and test positive for coronavirus, you should notify a trusted adult before taking any action.</p>

		<p>It's a legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive or are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. There are <a href="">very specific and limited exemptions</a>. You could be fined if you do not self-isolate.</a></p>
	</div>
	<h2>When to get a test</h2>
	<p>Get a test as soon as possible if you have any symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
	<p>The symptoms are:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>a high temperature</>
		<li>a new, continuous cough</>
		<li>a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste</>
	</ul>
	<p>The test needs to be done in the first 8 days of having symptoms. <a href="">Get a test to check if you have coronavirus on GOV.UK</a></p>

	<h2>If you're told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS COVID-19 app:</h2>
	<p>If the NHS COVID-19 app detects you've been at a venue with someone who has coronavirus, please self-isolate when you receive the message alert.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>self-isolate immediately</li>
		<li>do not leave your home for any reason - if you need food or medicine, order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off at your home</li>
		<li>do not have visitors in your home, including friends and family - except for essential care</li>
		<li>try to avoid contact with anyone you live with as much as possible</li>
		<li>any people you live with and any people in your support bubble do not need to self-isolate if you do not have symptoms</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Your self-isolation period includes the day you were last in contact with the person who tested positive and the next 10 full days. This means that if, for example, you were last in contact with the person on the 15th of the month, your isolation period ends at 23:59 hrs on the 25th.</p>
	<p>If you live with someone at <a href="">higher risk from coronavirus</a>, try to arrange for them to stay with friends or family while you're self-isolating.</p>
