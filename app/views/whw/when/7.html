	<h1>You have been told to self isolate by the NHS Covid-19 App</h1>
		<p>Until 17 December, the NHS COVID-19 app was designed to tell you to self-isolate for 14 days if you'd been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). </p>
		<p>Policy in England and Wales recently changed to make this 10 days instead. <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus" style="text-decoration:underline;">Read more about the self-isolation period in Wales</a>. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-chief-medical-officers-statement-on-the-self-isolation-period-11-december-2020" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Read more about the self-isolation period in England</a>. The app was updated to reflect this on 17 December. </p>
		<p>If you received a close contact alert on or before 17 December, the self-isolation timer on your app may still be telling you to self-isolate for longer than you need to. This is only if you're self-isolating because you've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, not if you're self-isolating because you have symptoms or have tested positive yourself. <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01318/en-us" style="text-decoration:underline;">Read about what this alert will look like</a>. </p>
		<h3>If you got this alert on 16 December or earlier</h3>
		<p>You can leave self-isolation when your timer says '3 days to go', unless you've been told to self-isolate for longer by contact tracing. This is when your self-isolation period of 10 full days will be complete. </p>
		<h3>If you got this alert on 17 December</h3>
		<p>You will need to check your 'encounter date' in the 'manage my data' section of the app. <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01365/en-us" style="text-decoration:underline;">Read more about how to find your encounter date</a>. You need to self-isolate for 10 full days from this date. </p>
		<p>For example, if your encounter date was 10 December, you would need to self-isolate up to and including 20 December. You could then stop self-isolating on 21 December. </p>
		<h3>If you get this alert on 18 December or later</h3>
		<p>You should self-isolate for the full time indicated by the app. </p>
